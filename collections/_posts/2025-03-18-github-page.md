Followed a guide [here](https://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) on creating a github page. I'm not a fan of the fact that I have to wait for Jekyllrb to build the site every time I push a change. I'm going to look into other options, but for now if this is what I need to use markdown, I'll do it!
